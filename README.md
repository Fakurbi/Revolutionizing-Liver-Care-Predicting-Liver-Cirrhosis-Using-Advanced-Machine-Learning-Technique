Revolutionizing Liver Care 🧬 Predicting Liver Cirrhosis using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

📝 Project Overview This project focuses on detecting and predicting Liver Cirrhosis using advanced machine learning algorithms. It provides a user-friendly Flask-based web interface where users can input medical parameters, and the system will predict whether a patient is at risk of developing liver cirrhosis.

💡 Key Features ✅ ML-based Cirrhosis Prediction using trained classification models 📈 Preprocessed clinical dataset for better accuracy 🧠 Random Forest classifier with model optimization 🖥️ Interactive Flask Web Interface for real-time predictions 💾 Saved model (rf_acc_68.pkl) and Normalizer (normalizer.pkl) for fast deployment 📱 Responsive and simple UI for easy data entry 🎥 Demo video for end-to-end project walkthrough

⚙️ Technologies Used • Python – core scripting • Scikit-learn / Pandas / NumPy – for data preprocessing and ML model • Flask – for building the web interface • HTML / CSS / JS – for frontend styling • Jupyter Notebook – for model training and evaluation

✅ How to Run

Clone the repository bash CopyEdit git clone https://github.com/Fakurbi/Revolutionizing-Liver-Care-Predicting-Liver-Cirrhosis-Using-Advanced-Machine-Learning-Technique
Install dependencies bash CopyEdit pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application bash CopyEdit python app.py
Open in browser Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the liver cirrhosis prediction system.
👨‍⚕️ Input Parameters The model takes various health and diagnosis-related inputs like: • Age • Total Bilirubin • Direct Bilirubin • Alkaline Phosphotase • SGPT / SGOT • Total Proteins • Albumin / Globulin Ratio … and more

👨‍💻 Developed By • Gangalapudi Venkatesh Reddy

📌 Note This is a proof-of-concept project aimed at highlighting the potential of ML in medical diagnostics. For production-grade applications, it should be trained with larger and real-world datasets and validated against clinical standards.
